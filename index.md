  ## The Chinese Emperor's 'Hindustan' Jades

excerpt: "This website is a starting point for [Project Kleutghen](https://github.com/Project-Kleutghen)". “The Chinese Emperor’s Hindustan Jades” integrates text analysis,
 mapping, and interactive image viewers to visualize eighteenth-century China’s engagement with the Islamic world. The textual dataset is a group of approximately one 
 hundred poems that the Qianlong emperor (r. 1736-1795) wrote about and ordered incised into the Islamic jades in his collection. The image/object dataset is the group
 of extant inscribed jades. Comparing the published printed text and the inscribed text reveals that they are not identical, and the same text could be inscribed onto 
 multiple objects from different places around the Islamic world. The bilingual textual analysis and object-centered stylistic comparisons will be presented in a map 
 and embedded image viewer that combines methodology from historical GIS and digital art history, with an emphasis on open source tools and open access scholarship. 
 At this stage of the project, both Sarah and Gloria are learning Python: Sarah will use it for Chinese textual analysis and comparison, while Gloria will use it
 together with the Folium library to create maps in Leaflet. Professor Kleutghen is focusing on image presentation with IIIF, which integrates with Leaflet and allows
 image annotations that will be drawn from the text analysis.

## Customising

When using Alembic as a theme means you can take advantage of the file overriding method. This allows you to overwrite any file in this theme with your own custom file, by matching the file name and path. The most common example of this would be if you want to add your own styles or change the core style settings.

To add your own styles copy the [`styles.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/assets/styles.scss) into your own project with the same file path (`assets/styles.scss`). From there you can add your own styles, you can even optionally ignore the theme styles by removing the `@import "alembic";` line.

If you're looking to set your own colours and fonts you can overwrite them by matching the variable names from the [`_settings.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_sass/_settings.scss) file in your own `styles.scss`, make sure to state them before the `@import "alembic";` line so they take effect. The settings are a mixture of custom variables and settings from [Sassline](https://medium.com/@jakegiltsoff/sassline-v2-0-e424b2881e7e) - follow the link to find out how to configure the typographic settings.
